# XzaarScript [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zerratar/XzaarScript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zerratar/XzaarScript)

## Introduction
If Rust and TypeScript had a baby, this might be it. It's ugly, it's incomplete, it's buggy. But I love it! Originally created for a game I was making in Unity. But it took too long to develop that I didn't have time to finish it. Now here it is, free for everyone to use!

XzaarScript is written in C#, .NET Framework v4.6.1 using Visual Studio 2017

You can test out the demo website  [here](http://xzaarscript.shinobytes.com)
